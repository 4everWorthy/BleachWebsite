ChatGPT prompt...
I need you to be my design assistant and help me create the HTML and CSS for a webpage. The goal is to create a semi-functional webpage centered around the Japanese Manga, Bleach. Specifically, the character Ichigo.
Theme Selection: 1000 year blood war
Content Requirements:
At least one header section with the title center page.
A navigation bar with at least three links that are placed side by side.
At least one image.
Main content area with at least three sections/articles.
A footer with copyright and contact information.
Design Requirements:
Use of external CSS for styling.
The design should be responsive and visually appealing
Add a background image to the html code

I attempted to center the title of the page, however, I havne't been able to figure out how to do this just yet. Adding the background was chanllenging as well. ChatGPT added the code for the background into the css code, after tinkering with it for a bit and moving the code to the htlm file, I was able to get the background added.
